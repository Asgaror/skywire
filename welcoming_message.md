## Introduction
<br>
<div align="center">
<b> We are happy to welcome you on board the Skyfleet, please read this guide thoroughly to not miss out on any important information.</b>

**The steps you're about to follow are:**
1. Reading up on the Skywire testnet rules & requirements to be eligible for being rewarded
2. Assembling your official Skyminer
3. Flashing the micro sd cards with the prepared images or installing Skywire from source
4. Verifying the network settings of the official Skyminer's future networking environment
5. Registring your public keys in our new Skywire Whiteslisting System to start receiving rewards

## Assembly
The assembly of the official Skyminer may take you anywhere from 2-6h, depending on how experienced and handy you are. 
<div align="center">
<p>
<b><u>Contact support</u> via the <a href"https://store.skycoin.net/pages/support">support form</a> if you need some advice or anything is missing in your package.</b>
</p>
</div>
You can find a comprehensive assembly manual by following <a href="https://downloads.skycoin.net/skywire/Skywire_Miner_Assembly_Manual_2_1.pdf"> this link</a> or at <a href="skycoin.net/downloads">skycoin.net/downloads</a>

***

## Software
The software part of the official Skyminer setup can be done via two different ways:
* You can use the [prepared images](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire#download-system-images) from our github to have the least amount of work
    * The official images will be updated once again for the mainnet launch. Until then you will have to use the provided [one time upgrade script](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/tree/master/static/script/upgrade) to get to the new Skywire user interface (UI)
* You can install everything from [source](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/wiki/Skyminer-Skywire-installation-guide#installation-from-source) by using a clean image. This option will teach you the most but takes a little more effort.

The [software installation guide](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/wiki/Skyminer-Skywire-installation-guide) will help you to perform either of the two steps. 

<div align="center">

<b>Contact support if you need help for any of the two steps.</b>

## Registration
We recently launched a new Skywire Whitelisting System that simplifies the data management of the Skywire testnet. <br>
The [Skywire Whitelisting System](https://whitelist.skycoin.net) ([get to the guide](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/wiki/Skywire-Whitelisting-System)) serves you as an account database that allows you to view & change your submitted data at will:
* The associated public keys of your boards 
* Your Skycoin reward address
* Submit new applications if you decide to build a DIY miner in compliance with the testnet rules

We automated the account creation for all official Skyminer purchasers. This means that you got here by following the instructions in the automated email you received after your account was prepared for you. The only thing that is left for you to do, is to set your own password and submit your data. 

### Password & Data Submission
You need to perform three tasks:
1) Setup your own password
2) Confirm your account
3) Cnter your public keys & Skycoin wallet address

#### 1) Setup your own password
Please use the link in your email to [auth.skycoin.net](https://auth.skycoin.net) to assign your personal password. If you receive an error saying that the personal access token expired, simply request a new one by clicking on *Forgot your password?*. 

#### 2) Confirm your account
Once that's done you need to confirm your account by logging into [auth.skycoin.net](https://auth.skycoin.net) and clicking on the confirm account button. You will receive a confirmation link sent to your email that verifies your account.

#### 3) Enter your public keys & Skycoin wallet address
After you confirmed your account you need to switch to [whitelist.skycoin.net](https://whitelist.skycoin.net) to access the Skywire Whitelisting System.
Switch to your 'Account Info' by using the menu bar:
<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/official_skyminer_welcoming/menu_bar.png"
     alt="Menu bar Skywire Whitelisting System"/>
</div>
<br>

You will be looking at this screen and you need to paste your Skycoin wallet reward address.

<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/official_skyminer_welcoming/account_details.png"
     alt="Updating the Skycoin wallet reward address."/>
</div>
<br>

<div align="center"><em>Differently to people submitting new applications, everyone of you will find an empty miner in their 'Miner' category.</em></div>

Next you have to switch to 'Miner' by using the menu bar, this is what you will be looking at:

<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/official_skyminer_welcoming/miner_list.png"
     alt="Your individual miner list."./>
<em>The empty official Skyminer that needs to be updated with your public keys.</em>
</div>
<br>

Next, please click on the pencil in the blue circle to edit your official Skyminer.
<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/official_skyminer_welcoming/miner_overview.png"
     alt="Empty official Skyminer that was allocated together with the account creation"./>
<em>The empty official Skyminer that needs to be updated with your public keys.</em><br>
Inserting your data can be achieved by pasting your public keys obtained from the manager's web interface into the empty public key text entry boxes.
</div>
<br>

<br>
<div align="center">
<em>In case you have less than 8 public keys because you received DOA components, simply submit as many public keys as you have at the time and update the keys once you received your replacement.<br>
Don't forget to request your replacement from the support!</em>
</div>
<br>

Once you pasted all of your public keys simply press 'Submit' and your public keys are stored. To be absolutely sure please refresh the page and verify your keys.


<br>
<div align="center">
<p>
<b>Contact support via the <a href="https://store.skycoin.net/pages/support">support form if you need replacements or help to perform any of the steps!</a> </b>
</p>
</div>


## Operating Instructions
Now that you performed all of the previous steps the only task that's left is to _keep your nodes online_ to meet [the requirements to be rewarded](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/blob/master/testnet_rules.md#facts).

Please check out [this guide](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/wiki/How-to-verify-that-your-nodes-are-online) to verify that your nodes are online if you haven't done that already. 

<div align="center"> 
<b>You are responsible for keeping your nodes online but never hesitate to ask for support if you have any issues!</b>
</div>

## Troubleshooting 
The two sold batches of official Skyminers helped us to aquire some important knowledge what you may try it in case you encountered different issues. This section will be updated from time to time to reflect recent issues.

### Dead On Arrival 
In case you assume you received DOA orange pi prime boards, because they can't be access via SSH and/or are not showing up in the manager web interface, 
please perform the following troubleshooting steps:
* reboot the router
* reboot the manager
* reboot the board(s) in question

<div align="center">
<b>Don't operate on live equipment. Always make sure the devices are turned off before you touch them. Follow the safety precautions from the <a href="https://downloads.skycoin.net/skywire/Skywire_Miner_Assembly_Manual_2_1.pdf">assembly guide</a></b>
</div>

If that doesn't help, continue:
* [reset the router](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/wiki/Networking-guide-for-the-official-router#resetting-the-router)
* turn off the board(s) in question
* exchange the micro sd cards with a working board (which must be turned off before extracting the micro sd card)
* exchange the power supply with a working board
* exchange the LAN cables with a working board
* switch the LAN port on the router with a working port
* measure the output voltage of the power switching unit (PSU):
    * the voltage should be at min. 5.0 V. Do not go above 5.3 V in any case.
    * increase the voltage in 0.1 V steps and check if the board is turning on after each increase
    

<div align="center">

<b>Contact support via the <a href="https://store.skycoin.net/pages/support">support form to request replacements of your faulty components!</a></b>
